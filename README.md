# Ted-Talk-Classifier
## Evaluation of different classifiers on Ted talks
Four different binary classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and KNN) have been trained and compared on titles and descriptions of Ted Talks
to classify them as popular/unpopular. <br/>
For vectorizing text to vectors, the tf-idf approach was used.<br/>
Results showed that The Naive Bayes classifier performed best, hence it was utilized to label the unlabled part of our data. (saved in the results directory)
